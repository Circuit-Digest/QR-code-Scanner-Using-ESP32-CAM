# 📸 QR Code Scanner Using ESP32-CAM 🖥️

This project showcases the creation of a [QR code scanner using the ESP32-CAM](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/esp32-cam-qr-code-scanner) module. Here ESP32-CAM captures images and sends them to a server with a QR code recognition program via an API request. Once the recognition is complete, the server responds with the decoded data. It's straightforward and with our [QR Code Scanner API](https://circuitdigest.com/article/qr-code-scanner-api-for-low-power-embedded-soc-boards), the process is smooth and efficient.
